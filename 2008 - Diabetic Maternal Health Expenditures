/* Model Building Process and Remediation Interpretation
We utilized multiple linear regression to build our model on the relationship between total health care expenditures and race/ethnicity for pregnant diabetic and non-diabetic women in the United States for the year of 2008. 
We used svy to incorporate survey weightage after setting the survey weight.

To assess linearity, we utilized VIF to identify any covariates with a VIF value higher than 10, which would denote an issue with linearity within the model.
While we did not identify any, we also ran rvfplot which revealed that there was a clear curvilinear trend, AKA an issue with linearity within the model.

To assess normality, we used three different tests.
The Shapiro-Wilks test was the initial test we utilized.
	A statistically significant result would mean that there are issues with normality within the model, which we did identify.
We used White’s test after to confirm this, which resulted in a statistically significant result.
	This meant that there were issues with normality within the model.
	However, White’s test is not always accurate.
Finally, we used the Breusch-Pagan test, which resulted in a statistically significant result.
	This meant that there were issues with normality within the model.
	It was finally accepted by our standards as heteroskedastic. 

We know that our base model has issues with linearity and heteroskedasticity.
	One way to address this would be to drop influential outliers in the models.
	However in expenditure models, this is not the right move! 
	Dropping influential cases would drop the sickest people in the dataset with higher expenditure costs.
To remediate our model we attempted to transform Y, which was total health care expenditures.
	We could have categorized this, but since we were interested in total health care expenditures as a continuous measure, we did not want to.
	Instead, we added 1 and took the log, square, and cubic transformation of total health care expenditures.
	We added 1 because with expenditure models, the dataset is usually right skewed because of a lack of 0 or non-zero values.
Of the three transformations, log transformation was the best fit with a r-squared value of 0.1012 or 10.12% model fitness.

/* Model Interpretation
In 2008, after adjusting for the highest education degree, insurance coverage, poverty level, region, and marital status…
	Black pregnant women had a 37.37% lower total health care expenditures cost compared to White pregnant women.
		Only this association is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.021 (barely).
	We did not observe a significant difference in cost among Asian, Hispanic, and other pregnant women compared to White women.
Diabetic pregnant women of all races had a 123.87% higher total health care expenditures cost compared to non-diabetic pregnant women.
	This association was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.017.
We can see that the r-squared value is 0.1012 and the p-value is less than 0.001, meaning that the model fitness is 10.12% and is statistically significant.
	The lower percentage of model fitness is to be expected due to the covariates in the model being all categorical.

/*Interpretation of interactions
We can see that none of the associations are statistically significant.
	Despite this, we see some interaction effects when looking at the coefficients for Black and Asian pregnant women.
While the coefficients have the same direction, their coefficients are different. 
	So it looks like the difference in cost when compared to the reference group stems from whether they have diabetes or not.
After stratification by diabetic and non-diabetic pregnant women we can see that…
	Among people with diabetes, the cost of care during the evaluation period was 54.24% lower for Black pregnant women compared to White pregnant women.
	Among people with diabetes, the cost of care during the evaluation period was 26.6% lower for Asian pregnant women compared to White pregnant women.
	Among those without diabetes, the cost of care during the evaluation period was 34.86% lower for Black pregnant women compared to White pregnant women.
	Among those without diabetes, the cost of care during the evaluation period was 25.51% lower for Asian pregnant women compared to White pregnant women.
