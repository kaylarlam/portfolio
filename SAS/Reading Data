*For its first 180 years, almost every justice on the Supreme Court of the United States was a white male Protestant.
Only four women have ever served on the highest court.
Here they are, with their birth year and year appointed.
Create a SAS dataset that includes their first name (to save some typing), year born, and year appointed.
Calculate each woman’s age when she was nominated.
Also calculate the average age of nomination.;

*Create a SAS dataset: sc_justices;

*The average age of nomination was 54 years old;

*The Song of Ice and Fire begins in the reign of King Robert Baratheon, who usurped the throne from the Mad King Aerys Targaryen,
ending the Targaryen dynasty (for now). Robert dies in the first book / season, and hilarity ensues.
Here are data about the most recent Kings of Westeros, including the years they took the throne and the year they died.
Enter them into SAS and calculate who reigned the longest.;

*The dataset Sybor Baby.txt contains data about the habits of a newborn child belonging to the professor Tavid Sybor.
The text file ostensibly contains information about the day of the month, number of hours of sleep, the baby food eaten at dinner,
and the hour of bedtime for Sybor’s child for each day of the week.
Due to sleep deprivation, the data file is not perfect.
Read the data into SAS and calculate the mean number of hours of sleep that the baby is getting.;

*Read the data into SAS;

*The mean number of hours of sleep that the baby is getting is 2.3846154 hours a night during the observation period;
